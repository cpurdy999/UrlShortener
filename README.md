UrlShortener demo project using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework

The DB is configured to use SQL Server Express LocalDB with the default connection string. If you want to use a different SQL connection, connection string can be edited in the [development appsettings file](https://github.com/cpurdy999/UrlShortener/blob/main/UrlShortener/appsettings.Development.json)
